# sql-portfolio
A list of SQL projects I have worked on.

- Each SQL project contains a set of README file, schema file, and query file.
- **Project README**: Contains all necessary information about the work while disucssing ERDs, Limitations, and Key Attributes.
- **Project schema** (When developing from scratch): Contains tables schema development within RDMS with primary keys identified.
- **Project query**: Highlights common queries, advanced queries including CTEs.
